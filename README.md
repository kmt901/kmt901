### Hi, I'm Kaya 👋

I’m a technologist, writer and public speaker. I'm the creator of [We Read Too](wereadtoo.com), a book resource app that features books for kids and teens with main characters of colors written by Black, Latinx, Asian and Indigenous authors. Previously, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Calm and a iOS Engineer at Slack. 

- 🤓  Continually learning SwiftUI.
- 💬  Ask me about mobile development and accessibility.
- 😄  Pronouns: she/her
- 🚴🏽‍♀️  Fun fact: I love cycling, I've done a century ride of 108 miles from Oakland to Sacramento and completed 2 triathlons.
